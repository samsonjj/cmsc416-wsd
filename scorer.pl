#   One of Natural Language Processing's (NLP's) essential challenges is word sense disambiguation (WSD). Similar spellins of
# a single word often have different meanings. This can be seen in the dictionary, where most words have multiple
# definitions. For example, run can be used to describe quick physical linear movement on foot, or the action of running
# for a position in an organization. WSD takes up the issue of automatically distinguishing the particular definition, or sense,
# of a word in text. This project applies WSD techniques to distinguise between two sense of the word "line": that of a phone
# line, and that of a product line.
